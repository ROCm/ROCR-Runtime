 *
 * @details The application can use this function to create queues where AQL
 * packets are not parsed by the packet processor associated with an agent,
 * but rather by a unit of execution running on that agent (for example, a
 * thread in the host application).
 *
 * The application is responsible for ensuring that all the producers and
 * consumers of the resulting queue can access the provided doorbell signal
 * and memory region. The application is also responsible for ensuring that the
 * unit of execution processing the queue packets supports the indicated
 * features (AQL packet types).
 *
 * When the queue is created, the HSA runtime allocates the packet buffer using
 * @p region, and the write and read indexes. The initial value of the write and
 * read indexes is 0, and the type of every packet in the buffer is initialized
 * to ::HSA_PACKET_TYPE_INVALID. The value of the @e size, @e type, @e features,
 * and @e doorbell_signal fields in the returned queue match the values passed
 * by the application.
 *

 * the AQL packet buffer and any other queue metadata.
 *
 * @param[in] size Number of packets the queue is expected to hold. Must be a
 * power of 2 greater than 0.
 *
 * @param[in] type Queue type.
 *
 * @param[in] features Supported queue features. This is a bit-field of
 * ::hsa_queue_feature_t values.
 *
 * @param[in] doorbell_signal Doorbell signal that the HSA runtime must
 * associate with the returned queue. The signal handle must not be 0.
 *
