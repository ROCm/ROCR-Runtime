ROCR documentation
=====================

The ROCm runtime (ROCR) is AMD's implementation of HSA runtime, which is a thin, user-mode API that exposes the necessary interfaces to access and interact with graphics hardware driven by the AMDGPU driver set and the ROCK kernel driver. To learn more, see :ref:`what-is-rocr-runtime`

You can access ROCR code on our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/ROCm/ROCR-Runtime>`_.
