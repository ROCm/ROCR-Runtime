# HSA Runtime API and runtime for ROCm

This repository includes the user-mode API interfaces and libraries necessary
for host applications to launch compute kernels to available HSA ROCm kernel
agents. Reference source code for the core runtime is also available.

## Documentation

Run the steps below to build documentation locally.

```
cd docs

pip3 install -r .sphinx/requirements.txt

python3 -m sphinx -T -E -b html -d _build/doctrees -D language=en . _build/html
```

## Initial target platform requirements

* CPU: Intel Haswell or newer, Core i5, Core i7, Xeon E3 v4 & v5; Xeon E5 v3
* GPU: Fiji ASIC (AMD R9 Nano, R9 Fury and R9 Fury X)
* GPU: Polaris ASIC (AMD RX480)

## Source code

The HSA core runtime source code for the ROCR runtime is located in the `src`
subdirectory. Please consult the associated `README.md` file for contents and
build instructions.

## Binaries for Ubuntu & Fedora and installation instructions

Pre-built binaries are available for installation from the ROCm package
repository. For ROCR, they include:

Core runtime package:

* HSA include files to support application development on the HSA runtime for
  the ROCR runtime
* A 64-bit version of AMD's HSA core runtime for the ROCR runtime

Runtime extension package:

* A 64-bit version of AMD's runtime tools library
* A 64-bit version of AMD's runtime image library

The contents of these packages are installed in `/opt/rocm/hsa` and `/opt/rocm`
by default.
The core runtime package depends on the `hsakmt-roct-dev` package.

Installation instructions can be found in the ROCm manifest repository
`README.md`:

## Infrastructure

The HSA runtime is a thin, user-mode API that exposes the necessary interfaces
to access and interact with graphics hardware driven by the AMDGPU driver set
and the ROCK kernel driver. Together they enable programmers to directly harness
the power of AMD discrete graphics devices by allowing host applications to
launch compute kernels directly to the graphics hardware.

The capabilities expressed by the HSA Runtime API are:

* Error handling
* Runtime initialization and shutdown
* System and agent information
* Signals and synchronization
* Architected dispatch
* Memory management
* HSA runtime fits into a typical software architecture stack.

The HSA runtime provides direct access to the graphics hardware to give the
programmer more control of the execution. An example of low level hardware
access is the support of one or more user mode queues provides programmers with
a low-latency kernel dispatch interface, allowing them to develop customized
dispatch algorithms specific to their application.

The HSA Architected Queuing Language is an open standard, defined by the HSA
Foundation, specifying the packet syntax used to control supported AMD/ATI
Radeon © graphics devices. The AQL language supports several packet types,
including packets that can command the hardware to automatically resolve
inter-packet dependencies (barrier `AND` & barrier `OR` packet), kernel dispatch
packets and agent dispatch packets.

In addition to user mode queues and AQL, the HSA runtime exposes various virtual
address ranges that can be accessed by one or more of the system's graphics
devices, and possibly the host. The exposed virtual address ranges either
support a fine grained or a coarse grained access. Updates to memory in a fine
grained region are immediately visible to all devices that can access it, but
only one device can have access to a coarse grained allocation at a time.
Ownership of a coarse grained region can be changed using the HSA runtime memory
APIs, but this transfer of ownership must be explicitly done by the host
application.

Programmers should consult the HSA Runtime Programmer's Reference Manual for a
full description of the HSA Runtime APIs, AQL and the HSA memory policy.

## Known issues

* Each HSA process creates an internal DMA queue, but there is a system-wide
limit of four DMA queues. When the limit is reached HSA processes will use
internal kernels for copies.
